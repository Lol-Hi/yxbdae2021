## Project Title
Movie Review Website (using Flask)

----
## Description
This is a website that lists out details of the top 250 movies of all time,
and allows users to leave a rating and review for the movies
â€“ much like the IMDb website.

There is also an API service which provides details like the
title, year of release, IMDb ID, director, actors and IMDb rating of the movie,
as well as the number of reviews provided by users on the site
and the average rating given by the users of this site for the movie.

----
## Motivations
Honestly there isn't any personal motivation for this project other than to
get the marks for my CEP grade (since this is an assigned task anyway). ðŸ˜‡

## Screenshots, Features and Code Snippets

#### Homepage
There is really nothing much to the homepage except for some movie recommendations, which are simply 5 random movies taken from the Postgresql database.

###### Function for the homepage
```python
# in application.py

@app.route("/")
def index():
    """
    Renders the homepage, with movie recommendations
    """
    #get the ids of 5 random movies from the Postgres database
    db_movies = db.execute(
        "SELECT \"imdbID\" FROM movies ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 5"
    )
    movie_lst = []
    #get the movie class for each of the 5 movies based on the id
    for movie_idrow in db_movies.fetchall():
        movie_lst.append(get_movie(db, movie_idrow[0]))
    return render_template("index.html", movies=movie_lst)
```

###### Function to retrieve the relevant movie class
```python
# in movie.py

def get_movie(db, id):
    """
    Retrieves the exact movie based on the IMDb ID
    """
    #if a class has not been created for the movie, retrieve the movie data from the Postgresql database and create a class for the movie
    if id not in Movie.movie_cache:
        db_res = db.execute(
            "SELECT \"Title\", \"Year\", \"Runtime\", \"imdbID\", \"imdbRating\" FROM movies WHERE \"imdbID\" = :id",
            {"id": id}
        )
        movie_row = db_res.fetchone()
        #if the movie is not part of the 250 movies, return None
        if not(movie_row):
            return None
        return Movie(movie_row["Title"], movie_row["Year"], movie_row["Runtime"], movie_row["imdbID"], movie_row["imdbRating"])
    return Movie.movie_cache[id]
```

#### Login and Signup pages
The login page is the usual one which only requires the username and password of the user.
The signup page is also relatively simple with the username, email and 2 fields for the password (password and confirm password).

The password is checked locally by checking the entered password against the password saved in the database â€“ instead of directly using SQL statements â€“ such that SQL injection would not occur.
Furthermore, the passwords are hashed when they are saved in the database to further prevent against SQL injection and since it is a one-way hash, anyone with access to the database would still be unable to get the password of someone else's account.

###### Functions for the login and signup pages
```python
# in application.py

#### Search function
For the search box I used 3 functions to process the query â€“ one to search based on title, another on the year and finally, the IMDb ID. The search then leads to a page where the results are listed out.

If the search button is clicked without any search query, the user is redirected back to the homepage.

###### Function to display the search results
```python
# in application.py

@app.route("/search_results", methods=["POST"])
def search():
    """
    Processes the search request and produces the results
    """
    #get the search query
    search_query = request.form.get("search")
    #if there is no search query, redirect to the homepage
    if not(search_query):
        return redirect(url_for(".index"))
    #search for results based on the search query
    search_results = set() #to ensure that there is no overlap in results from the 3 search functions
    search_results.update(search_title(db, search_query))
    search_results.update(search_year(db, search_query))
    search_results.update(search_id(db, search_query))
    #list out the search results in another page
    return render_template(
        "search_results.html",
        query=search_query,
        search_results=search_results,
        search_present=(len(search_results) > 0)
    )
```

###### Functions to carry out the search
```python
# in movie.py

def search_title(db, search_query):
    """
    Searches the database for movies whose title contains the search query
    """
    #get the ids of the movie whose title contains the search query
    db_results = db.execute(
        "SELECT \"imdbID\" FROM movies WHERE lower(\"Title\") LIKE :query",
        {"query": "%{}%".format(search_query.lower())}
    )
    search_results = []
    #get the movie class for each of movies based on the id
    for movie_idrow in db_results.fetchall():
        search_results.append(get_movie(db, movie_idrow[0]))
    return search_results

def search_year(db, search_query):
    """
    Searches the database for movies whose year contains the search query
    """
    #get the ids of the movie whose year contains the search query
    db_results = db.execute(
        "SELECT \"imdbID\" FROM movies WHERE \"Year\"::TEXT LIKE :query",
        {"query": "%{}%".format(search_query)}
    )
    search_results = []
    #get the movie class for each of movies based on the id
    for movie_idrow in db_results.fetchall():
        search_results.append(get_movie(db, movie_idrow[0]))
    return search_results

def search_id(db, search_query):
    """
    Searches the database for movies whose IMDb ID starts with the search query
    (search query has to be tt*******)
    """
    #get the ids of the movie whose IMDb ID starts with the search query
    db_results = db.execute(
        "SELECT \"imdbID\" FROM movies WHERE \"imdbID\" LIKE :query",
        {"query": "{}%".format(search_query)}
    )
    search_results = []
    #get the movie class for each of movies based on the id
    for movie_idrow in db_results.fetchall():
        search_results.append(get_movie(db, movie_idrow[0]))
    return search_results
```

#### Movie pages
Each individual movie page consists of data from the OMDb API and a review section at the bottom of the page.
Only users who are logged in can post a review and each user can only post one review per account per movie.

When leaving a rating, users simply have to click the green stars in the rating section to indicate the number of stars they want to give for the movie.
A hidden field is used to process the input given from the star buttons.

###### Function to display the movie page and process reviews

Congrats to u u've probably found the easiest way to get out of this madness
Simply find the link inside this photo:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B7nw72H80jQSUv2EH7f3ZXIz5Dyir57C/view?usp=sharing

and come on lah i spent so much time setting the other 2 methods
do give them a go pls pls pls

###### Methods to deal with user reviews

        """
        Adds a review to the review table in the Postgresql database

#### API calls
The site also provides an API service where it would return the
- Title of the movie
- Year of the movie's release
- IMDb ID for the movie
- Director of the movie
- Actors in the movie
- IMDb rating for the movie
- Number of reviews left for the movie on this site
- Average rating left by users for the movie

## How to Use?
Before running the program, you will have to [set up a few environment variables](https://www.schrodinger.com/kb/1842).
- `FLASK_APP` â€“ Determines the program to run for the website.
  Set it to "application.py".
- `DATABASE_URL` â€“ URL to access the database.
  Set it to "postgres://qcqbnwzpratskd:25135160d72db5cbc00f6ff96a90582b7bf987b5dbae34a6c2deed9158777057@ec2-107-22-238-217.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d2tmhfjd6dsefu".
- `OMDB_KEY` â€“ API key for the OMDb database.
  Register at http://www.omdbapi.com/ to get it.
- `HASH_SALT` â€“ Salt used when hashing passwords.
  If not set, will default to "salt".
  Ensure that you use the same salt every time you access the same account.

To run the program and view the website,
1. In the command line, navigate to the directory containing the app
2. Type `$ flask run` to start up the application
3. Among the lines produced, there should one that says `* Running on <URL>`. Copy the URL to your browser to see the website

The movie pages can be accessed by searching with the search box on the navbar.
Alternatively, you can access any movie page directly by its IMDb ID with `/movie/<IMDb_ID>`.

There is also an API service that can be accessed with `/api/<IMDb_ID>`.
